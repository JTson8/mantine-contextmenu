        Please target your PRs to the <Code>next</Code> branch.

        If you want to implement a new feature or improve an existing one, make sure to add an example page and/or alter
        the one(s) already referring to it.
        <br />
        It‚Äôs not a feature if other people don‚Äôt know about it or don‚Äôt understand how to use it.

      <PageSubtitle value="Why do repository stars matter" />
      <Txt>
        The more stars this repository gets, the more visibility it gains among the Mantine users community. The more
        users it gets, the more chances that some of those users will become active code contributors willing to put
        their effort into bringing new features to life and/or fixing bugs.
        <br />
        As the repository gain awareness, my chances of getting hired to work on Mantine-based projects will increase,
        which in turn will help maintain my vested interest in keeping the project alive.
